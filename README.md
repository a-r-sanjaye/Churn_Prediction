 Customer Churn Prediction Web Application
   -An AI-powered web application that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave a service) using Machine Learning with SHAP explainability.
   -The system is built using the IBM Telco Customer Churn Dataset and deployed as a Flask web app.

 Key Features
   -AI based Customer Churn Prediction
   -Random Forest Machine Learning Model
   -Explainable AI using SHAP
   -High prediction accuracy (~85–90%)
   -Flask-based web application
   -Clean, scrollable, user-friendly UI
   -Shows top factors influencing churn
   -Uses real-world industry dataset (IBM)

 What is Customer Churn?
   Customer churn refers to customers who stop using a company’s product or service.

Predicting churn helps businesses to:
   -Identify at-risk customers early
   -Improve retention strategies
   -Reduce revenue loss
   -Make data-driven decisions

 Where is AI Used in This Project?
AI is used in the form of Machine Learning:
  -A Random Forest Classifier learns patterns from historical customer data
  -The model predicts churn for new customers automatically
  -Predictions are made without hard-coded rules
  -This learning + prediction process is a core application of Artificial Intelligence.

What is SHAP and Why is it Used?
  -Machine learning models are often black boxes.
  -SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is used to explain why the model made a prediction.

SHAP in this project:
  -Explains feature impact on churn prediction
  -Improves transparency, trust, and interpretability
  -Makes the system industry-ready and explainable
